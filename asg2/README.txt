Ok, so here's the paragraph of what I did for assignment 2;

I, in essence, crafted a 2D array that held height values, rounded to 
the nearest whole number, that were based off of the Perlin Noise. 
I used those heights to create cubes, with textures I stole off the 
internet, I repeat, I STOLE THE TEXTURES OFF THE INTERNET. Literally
google "Dirt/Water/Grass/Snow square textures" and they'll show up.
The noise was just used for the height variable, the rest was
predetermined and can be modified. You can also pass in a seed to the
world building constructor, and it'll craft the same world every time
you refresh the page. You can move around using standard FPS controls.
Have fun!
