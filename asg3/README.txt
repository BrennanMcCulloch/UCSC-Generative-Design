Ok, so here's the paragraph of what I did for assignment 3;

I didn't understand this project very well, and had to turn
it in late because of personal reasons. I followed the
instructions, but didn't know how to turn the text string
into anything legible. So I basically did everything I could
except turn it into an actual story. The data structure is there.

Have fun! If you can.
